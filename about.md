I’m just a tech guy with a crazy two-year-old girl that won't fall asleep at night until I play a certain playlist of songs from Chrono Trigger. She calls it "Twigga bedtime."

I can carry on an in-depth conversation how the isekai genre has taken over anime, how Savage Hulk was denied a proper redemptive arc in Endgame, and how there's no feeling in the world like being in the arena of a college basketball game when your team takes down a top 5 squad. 

In my free time, I also have the occasion to game. My game setup has bloated to require three different types of switcher (four HDMI, one  SCART, and two Extron matrix switchers) and two HDMI splitters to hook everything up. My work desk skulks in one corner of the room, crisscrossed with wires from two monitors, two PVMs, a scan converter, a DAC, and an RGB to YPbPr modulator. 

I appreciate technology some would find dated. I recently drove forty miles to buy a JVC D-series CRT that rolled off the assembly line in August of 2000, and I was happy to get it. In fairness, the woman selling it was happy, too. It was large and heavy, and belonged to her ex husband.



### My Coding Chops

JavaScript is where I've done most of my work, but CSS and HTML are close frenemies. I've been working more with Node.js/Express, mongoose, and React recently. Massaging logic to make functions work beautifully, sussing out the right combination to get a process rolling — I love that part of web development.

### What I want to learn

I want to get a solid hold of full stack development: a variety of frameworks for front end and back. You never know what will be useful in the future, so getting a hold of a variety will help me be prepared to dive in more deeply to whatever a project or company requires.

I also want to build on what I have: better understanding of React in particular, especially with how it handles props.
